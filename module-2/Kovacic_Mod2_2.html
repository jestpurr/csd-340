        <p class="intro"><span class="sentence">Hello, my name is Madi!</span> Some of my friends call me Flower instead. I'm an artist from NYC. I love food, games, ang guinea pigs! I have an aspiration to funnel my creativity into what I love.</p>
        <p>I primarily do character design in my artwork. I take pride in making cute designs come to life! While I strive in character design, I want to branch out into other skill sets as well.</p>
        <p>Aside from art, I also really enjoy cooking and media that has to do with food. I am not a 5-star chef, but I still enjoy making good food and trying new things! My favorite food is sushi.</p>
        <p>I come from a hispanic and latino family, and my family and culture all has amazing food of its own! My family  has been slowly teaching me their year old traditions. I hope to get good at it someday!</p>
