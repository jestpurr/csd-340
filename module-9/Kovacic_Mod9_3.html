        <h2>My Morning Routine</h2>
        <p>So I have gone through so much trial and error with my skincare routine. I've bought so many things and tried the extensive routine. A lot of money ended up down the drain.</p>
        
        <p>Thankfully, though, it's all been progress. I still don't really understand the ins and outs of a skincare routine, but I'm adjusting! I went from using 6 products every day to only 2-3 daily. My skin has cleared up so much!</p>
        
        <p>My skincare routine is now just a gentle cleanser and a really good moisturizer. <span id = "aerial">_________</span>
            <button type="button"
            onclick="document.getElementById('aerial').innerHTML = firstVariableValue">aerial</button> <br />  Yep. That's it. I do that, and then put on SPF to protect my skin. There are certain things you shouldn't be too cheap with, and skincare is one of those things.</p>
