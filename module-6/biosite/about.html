        <h2>About Zero</h2>
        <p>Zero, the robot masquerading as flesh. Zeroâ€™s art provokes a contemplation with humanity as a disabled queer person. He specializes in character design, illustration, and portrays bold contrasts and meaningful concepts. Growing up with autism, art became more than just a hobby for Zero. It was a vital means of expressing his thoughts, emotions, and his parallel to other people. Through his art, he found a way to bridge the gap between himself and others, using visual storytelling to convey his connection to life and his parallel existence alongside neurotypical people. His love of sci-fi media, which has been a constant source of inspiration, courses through much of his creative work. It influences not only the themes and aesthetics of his art but also his communication with others and his overall worldview. Despite sometimes feeling the weight of metal within his bones, a metaphor for the challenges he faces, Zero's heart and soul resonate deeply with the complexity and beauty of what it means to be undeniably human. His art challenges viewers to question their perceptions of identity, disability, and humanity, inviting them to see the world through his eyes. Eyes that see beyond the surface and into the profound depths of existence. Through his creative expressions, Zero reveals the truth that humanity is not defined by our physical forms, but by the richness of our inner lives and our capacity to connect with others. Despite adversity, Zero creates.</p>
